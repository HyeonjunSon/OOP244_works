In Workshop 9, I learned valuable lessons in C++ programming, particularly focusing on dynamically allocated resources and object-oriented principles like inheritance and diverse. The workshop involved implementing two classes, `Text` and `HtmlText`, which demonstrated the importance of managing memory with the Rule of Threeâ€”defining a copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor. This practice ensures that dynamically allocated memory is handled correctly, preventing leaks and undefined behavior. The `HtmlText` class extended `Text`, showcasing the use of inheritance and virtual functions to modify and extend base class functionality. Working with file I/O to read text files into memory and convert them into HTML format highlighted the necessity of careful error handling and efficient string manipulation. This task also provided insight into HTML formatting, replacing special characters with HTML entities, and structuring content with tags.
