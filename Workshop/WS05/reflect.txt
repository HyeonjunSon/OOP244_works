The account class provided a practical framework for applying these concepts. Member operators, such as operator+=, operator-=, and the assignment operators, allowed me to perform intuitive operations directly on Account objects. These operators simplify code readability and maintenance by enabling natural syntax for modifying account balances and assigning account details. For example, the operator+= and operator-= modify the account balance directly, while the assignment operators facilitate copying account information efficiently.
Helper functions, specifically operator+ and operator+= for combining account balances, showcased the importance of non-member functions that can still access private class members through the friend keyword. These functions enhance the flexibility and usability of the class, allowing for operations that involve multiple Account objects without compromising encapsulation.
The constructors in the Account class, both default and parameterized, provided a clear structure for initializing object states, ensuring that accounts could be instantiated with or without specific initial values.
The display function, a simple yet essential member function, reinforced the importance of providing clear, formatted output of an object's state, aiding in debugging and user interface development.
